# Python Application Template

## Overview

This is a foundational Python application template designed to provide a clean starting point for Python development projects. The application demonstrates proper project structure with basic logging setup, error handling capabilities, and input/output operations. It serves as a scaffold for building more complex Python applications with established best practices already in place.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Application Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: The application uses a monolithic structure with `main.py` as the primary entry point, suitable for small to medium-sized projects or as a foundation for larger applications
- **Modular design**: Functions are organized with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend and refactor as the application grows

### Logging System
- **Dual-output logging**: Configured to write logs to both file system (`logs/app.log`) and console output for development and production visibility
- **Configurable log levels**: Supports standard Python logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) with runtime configuration
- **Automatic directory creation**: Creates necessary log directories if they don't exist, ensuring robust deployment

### Error Handling Framework
- **Type hints**: Uses Python typing module for better code documentation and IDE support
- **Structured error handling**: Placeholder architecture ready for comprehensive exception handling implementation

### Development Features
- **Template-based approach**: Designed as a reusable template with placeholder functions for rapid development
- **Standard library focus**: Minimizes external dependencies by leveraging Python's built-in capabilities

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: Relies primarily on built-in modules including `sys`, `logging`, `os`, `typing`, and `datetime`
- **No external packages**: Currently uses no third-party dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to deploy

### Potential Integration Points
- **File system**: Direct interaction with the local file system for log storage
- **Standard I/O**: Configured for console input/output operations
- **Environment configuration**: Ready for environment variable integration through the `os` module
